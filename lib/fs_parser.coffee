What's Going On Here?
---------------------

This class is responsible for analyzing a roots project
and sorting each file into a category for processing later.
It can be fed a file or a directory, and will produce an object
containing arrays for `dirs`, `compiled`, `static`, and `dynamic`,
each array containing full paths to the specified file.

You will probably quickly notice that the FSParser class uses
a private ParseTask class for most of its logic.
This is because while there is only one FSParser per Roots
object, the `parse` method is async and it's possible
that more than one `parse` could be running at once.
Since each `parse` call outputs a shared ast, ast cannot be a
property of the FSParser class to prevent possible conflicts
between parallel-running `parse` calls, and would have to be
passed between each method call to keep it without conflict.
But to make this cleaner, we  utilize a private class that is
instantiated each `parse` call and can safely share the ast
between its methods.

There are only really two methods being called here,
`parse_dir` and `parse_file`. Starting with the directory parse,
we use readdirp to read through the project directory.
When it encounters a file (on 'data' event),
a few things happen. First, it checks to make sure the file
is not ignored. By using minimatch to test against the
file path, we can ensure that full globstar ignores
(like in .gitignore) are supported. Next, if the file is
nested in a directory, we push that to the ast directories
array. Finally, we process the file, and add that task to
an array which we resolve using
[when.all](https://github.com/cujojs/when/blob/master/docs/api.md#whenall)
once all the files have been read. On the way out,
one more task goes through `ast.dirs` and formats them
correctly, since they don't come out totally right initially.

The `parse_file` function is the logic core for this class.
Since dynamic files are processed before normally compiled files
because they make locals available in all other views, each
file needs to be analyzed to determine whether it contains
dynamic content or not. In order to do this as efficiently
as possible, only the first three bytes of each file is read
asynchrnously as a stream, which is all it takes to determine that the
 file does or does not contain dynamic content. See `./yaml_parser.coffee` for more details.
